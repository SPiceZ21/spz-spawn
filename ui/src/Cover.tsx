/*
 * The screen between the loading screen and the spawn menu.
 *
 * It exists because there is a window — world streaming, the ped model swap,
 * the outfit round-trip, the camera being built — where the game is showing
 * something real but not something anybody should see. spz-spawn puts this up
 * before any of that starts (`showCover`) and takes it down on the other side
 * (`hideCover`), so the player goes loading screen → brand → menu with nothing
 * raw in between.
 *
 * WHY IT IS BUILT THE WAY IT IS
 *
 * The backdrop is a MESH GRADIENT under a HALFTONE SCREEN. The mesh is five
 * overlapping radial fields in the theme accent over a near-black base — no
 * blur filter anywhere, because a full-screen `filter: blur()` in CEF
 * re-rasterises the whole surface and this page is on screen exactly when the
 * client has the least to spare. The softness is in the gradient stops instead.
 *
 * The halftone is two dot grids composited with `overlay` and `soft-light`
 * blend modes rather than drawn as their own layers. Blended that way the dots
 * take their strength FROM the mesh underneath: bright where the mesh blooms,
 * gone where it falls to black. That is the halftone response — dot weight
 * tracking luminance — for the cost of two extra background layers on an
 * element that was already being painted.
 *
 * THE EXIT IS THE POINT
 *
 * The old cover cross-faded to nothing, which is the one transition that makes
 * a loading hand-off look like a loading hand-off: for 700ms the brand and the
 * world are both half-there.
 *
 * This one is SLICED. The backdrop is split into vertical panels that sweep off
 * the sides — outermost first, working inward, so every panel travels over
 * screen that the panel before it has already vacated and nothing is ever seen
 * sliding across anything else. The content goes first and fast; the panels
 * follow as a curtain opening from both edges onto the menu underneath.
 *
 * The slices are not separate copies of the artwork. Each one carries the same
 * background stack sized to the VIEWPORT and offset by its own position
 * (`--bgx`), so the mesh and the dot grid run continuously across all eight
 * seams while the browser still only paints each slice's own area — the whole
 * stage costs about one screen, not eight.
